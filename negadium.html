	<p>This is the official website for the Terraria (as yet unreleased) Mod called <b>Negadium</b> or <b>Mharadium and Negativity</b></p>
	<h4>A quick summary of Negadium:</h4>
	<p class = summary>This mod has three main parts. Mharadium - this hellish, devilish themed part will add lots of new hell-bosses, destroyed biomes and other, demonic stuff. Then we have Negativity - this will mostly focus on space and void, but also some other stuff, including the human body, flesh and so on. This will mostly add a new type of bullet-hell bosses, and some new types of weapons. And finally, Pletharia. This part will mostly add early-game stuff, mosly summoner and thrower expansions.</p>
	<h4>A longer summary of Negadium:</h4>
	<p class = summary>This mod contains loads of items, enemies, at least a dozen bosses, and a couple thousand tons more. While most of the items that feature in spoilers are from the Mharadium part of the mod, there are two other parts, Pletheria, and Negativity. Pletheria is meant to be like a normal mod that enhances Vanilla Terraria by adding new things. This mod will be focussing on things from the start of the game till when you defeat the Moon Lord. At this point you wade into the magma of Mharadium and Negativity. While items will probably come from either Mharadium or Negativity, there will be a lot of cross content. In these latter parts of Negadium, we have been assured that the bosses will have an insanely stupid amount of health, defense and attack, but this will be counterbalanced by the super awesome weapons.</p>
