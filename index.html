<p>At this point, the website splits into a couple parts: imkSushi's Mod, The London Underground, Maths, and other stuff.</p>
<h2>imkSushi's Mod</h2>

<p>Now onto some actual stuff about my mod:</p>
<p class = Description>imkSushi's Mod is an essentials/quality of life mod. It adds hundreds of recipes to Terraria that means that any items that may be unobtainable in a world due to unfortunate world gen are now craftable. However, the main feature is that equivalent ore are now interchangeable at a Tinkerers Workbench, for example, you can swap iron for lead, or Titanium for Adamantite. Another prominent feature is that you can melt down many items back into the ore they came from at lava. For a more complete list of what this mod adds, see <a href="http://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/imksushis-mod.34233/">the thread for imkSushi's Mod</a>.</p>
<h2>The London Underground</h2>
<p>In case you didn't know, I know everything you ever, and never, wanted to know about the London Underground. Below, I have stuff about the London Underground:</p>
<p id = UndergroundStuff>The London Underground is the first Underground Railway in the world. It was opened on 10<sup>th</sup> January 1863 between Paddington (Bishop's Road) and Farringdon Street, via Edgeware Road, Baker Street, Portland Road, Gower Street, and King's Cross. Nowadays a lot of these have lightly different names: Paddington (Bishop's Road) has dropped the (Bishop's Road) bit, Portland Road has become Great Portland Street, Gower Street has become Euston Square, King's Cross has become King's Cross St Pancras, and Farringdon Street has dropped the 'Street' bit. Together, when they opened, they were called the Metropolitan railway. At this point, you may be expecting me to explain what happened next, but, on the contrary, I will explain what lead up to the circumstances that the London Underground was opened in the first place, and use that to explain what happened next. But I haven't written that bit yet, so tune in for more at a later date.</p>
